### Present
I’m Ioannis and I am a Product Manager. I currently work at a Ride-Hailing company focusing on Passenger Experience. I love solving problems, awesome products, nature, cultural escapes and spending time with family, friends and my dog

### Past
In the past, I have spent 7 years in London UK where I studied Software Engineering while working at Apple as a Retail Specialist. After graduating, I then moved to iOS Business Systems Analyst possition at Apple, then to a Solutions Engineer role at an AI computer Vision Startup called Cortexica (Acquired by Zebra)
