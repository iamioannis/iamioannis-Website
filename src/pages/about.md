title: About
---
My name is Ioannis Mastigopoulos and I created this website to be my own internet corner.
There are many corners that all this could exist but they wouldn't be mine
I might be using many platforms to share content but I also do believe in owning your content and also have a place that I make the decisions of where is what, how it is displayed and how I want to present it.

You can find about my work experience in a more CV like format you can check it here [Resume](../resume)

## Ways to Connect

I still like email so send a friendly letter at  [iamioannis@hey.com](<mailto:iamioannis@hey.com>)

On the other hand there is a whole world of the web where you can find me so you can pick your preferred way of communication
